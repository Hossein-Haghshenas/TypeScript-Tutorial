<h1 align="center">TypeScript In React</h1>

## Why TypeScript In React ?

1. With static type checking you got to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime

2. Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete

3. Makes maintenance and refactoring of large code bases much easier

## How to install TypeScript In React ?

`To start a new Create React App project with TypeScript template, you can run this code ` :

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
or
yarn create react-app my-app --template typescript
```

`To add TypeScript to an existing React App project, first install it ` :

```
npm install --save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
or
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

Next, rename any file to be a TypeScript file (e.g. src/index.js to src/index.tsx) and restart your development server!
